## 👋 Hello

I'm **Ellie White** (she/her), a **Water Resources Data Scientist** with the **One Water Practice Area at EKI Environment & Water**.  
About 90% of my work focuses on **data science projects**—developing predictive models, analytical workflows, and visual tools for urban water management.  
The remaining 10% is dedicated to **proposal writing, training development**, and building an **R package to improve reproducibility** in analytical workflows.  

---

### 💧 Examples of My Work at EKI
- Machine learning models in **R** to forecast water demand and inform infrastructure planning.  
- **Python–Oracle** integrations using `oracledb` and `sqlalchemy` for live data connections in analytics and dashboards.  
- Interactive **R Shiny** dashboards that help towns explore and negotiate water-sharing scenarios.

### 🛰 USGS Work (Available on GitLab)  
*Note: Access limited to USGS employees on VPN.*

- 🌍 **National Geospatial Attributes Template** – Created an R-based rescaling pipeline (`targets`) that transfers attributes between spatial polygons. Forked >10 times across USGS to support nationwide water availability assessments.  
- 🏁 **Land Cover Processing Workflow** – Built R and Python workflows to process CONUS-scale land cover data at the catchment level using HPC, producing inputs for machine learning models.  
- ✅ **Model Evaluation Pipeline** – Developed R pipelines for drought model evaluation and test/train splits on AWS S3. Integrated spatial basin groupings to handle autocorrelation and implemented drought pooling and matching methods.
